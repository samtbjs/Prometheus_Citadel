"""
tutor.py  —  turns ONE wrong answer into a study-guide card.

Splits cleanly into two kinds of content:
  * FACTS we already have (no AI needed): the snare name, the correct
    answer, and the worked solution from our verified bank.
  * GENERATED content (Prometheus Citadel's job): a friendly personalized explanation and a
    fresh follow-up practice question. These go through ask_gemma().

The `strategy` argument is how the AGENT adapts: if a plain explanation doesn't
land, it re-calls with a different strategy (see agent.py / the blueprint).
