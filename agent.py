agent.py  —  the AGENT CONTROLLER.

This is what makes the project an *agent* instead of a chatbot: after the quiz it
doesn't just react to each wrong answer, it looks across ALL of them, decides what
matters most, and drives toward a goal (student demonstrates understanding).

v1 implements the parts that don't need the model yet (analyze + prioritise +
escalation decision). The teach -> follow-up -> evaluate -> adapt loop is scaffolded
here and gets fleshed out once real Prometheus Lab AI is connected (see the Blueprint doc).
