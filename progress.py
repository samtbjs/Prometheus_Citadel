"""
progress.py  —  the progress summary at the top of the letters-home page.

THE RULE THIS MODULE EXISTS TO ENFORCE: CODE COMPUTES THE NUMBERS, PROMETHEUS CITADEL ONLY
INTERPRETS THEM. Every count, every best and latest drill score, every trend
and the headline itself are worked out here in plain Python from the session's
own records. The model is never asked how many, how often or whether something
went up — it is handed the finished facts and writes the sentences a parent
reads. This is the same guardrail used everywhere else in the app: the model
never recomputes the maths, and it never owns a figure.

Three things follow from that split:

  * The prose is checked before it ships. GPT is not allowed to state a
    figure at all — the counts are printed by code right beside its words — so
    any number in the reply, in digits or spelled out, means the reply is
    discarded and a deterministic sentence, built from the same facts, goes out
    instead. Prose vague enough to fit any child on any day is discarded the
    same way, and so is prose that contradicts the record — 'improving it
    quickly' about a drill fought once is a claim no parent can check.
  * Those refusals are not a failure mode, they are the feature. On the small
    1b model the deterministic sentence goes out often; it is composed from the
    same facts, so the page reads the same and every word of it is true.
  * The page can never break. If Ollama is not running, or the call raises, or
    the reply comes back empty, the fallback sentence is used and the parent
    still sees a complete summary.

Written for mum and dad, in the app's house language: a "snare" is the wrong
idea that feels right, and a single question is a "check question".
