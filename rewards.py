"""
rewards.py  —  AI-powered creative features for PROMETHEUS CITADEL.

Two small pieces of on-device flavor that make the game layer feel alive:

  * forge_relic()        — after a monster's snare is mastered, Prometheus Citadel forges a
                           unique collectible relic tied to the exact skill won.
  * battle_memory_line() — at an encounter, the monster speaks ONE line that
                           references the player's real history (past wins,
                           past losses, how many tries this fight has taken).

Design rules (same as the rest of the app):
  * Every function has a canned fallback in a try/except — a model failure can
    NEVER break the app.
  * Every human-facing string goes through plainify(): no LaTeX, no "$".
  * Output is parsed defensively; anything malformed falls back.
