"""
practice_sheet.py  —  a printable practice sheet for ONE trick.

The mastery loop lives on a screen; a kitchen table does not. This module takes
a single trick (the wrong idea that feels right) and lays out a sheet a parent
can print and work through with their child: numbered questions with room to
write, then an answer key on its own page.

Two rules decide what goes on the paper, in this order:

  1. BANK FIRST. Verified items tagged with the trick, then items from the same
     strand. They carry a ground-truth answer key AND a worked solution, so the
     parent is never left arguing with the paper about who is right.
  2. GENERATION LAST, AND ONLY UNDER AUDIT. If the bank runs dry, GPT writes
     the remainder one at a time, and each one must survive a blind self-solve
     (mastery._self_check applied to paper): the model solves its own question
     WITHOUT seeing the key it just wrote, and the question is thrown away
     unless the two agree. A small model marking its own wrong key is a real
     failure mode we caught in testing — on screen it costs one retry, on a
     printed sheet it would cost a parent's evening.

Hard call caps mean a sheet always finishes. If generation cannot fill the
quota, the sheet comes back short — never with a question we could not verify.
