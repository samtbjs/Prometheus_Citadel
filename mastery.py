"""
mastery.py  —  the autonomous mastery loop.

After the quiz diagnoses a snare, this module keeps the agent working the
problem until the student demonstrates understanding or a safety cap trips:

    TEACH (Prometheus Citadel, strategy-specific lesson)
      -> CHECK (a fresh question on the same snare)
      -> EVALUATE (deterministic when the check question comes from the bank)
      -> ADAPT (plain code: mastery, next strategy, or parent hand-off)

Design rules (from the project blueprint):
  * Adaptation = advancing through a FIXED strategy ladder — each retry is a
    genuinely different teaching approach, never an open-ended invention.
  * Evaluation prefers bank questions, where the answer key is ground truth.
  * Hard caps guarantee termination: the demo cannot loop forever.
